# Images Folder

This folder is used to store all static image assets for the project. Organize images into subfolders based on their usage:

- **logos/**: For company logos or branding images.
- **banners/**: For homepage or section banners.
- **products/**: For product-related images.
- **icons/**: For small icons used in the UI.

Example structure:
```
public/
  images/
    logos/
    banners/
    products/
    icons/
```

Place your images in the appropriate subfolder and reference them in your code using paths starting with `/images/`.
